## C++ to C converter

Compilation:
run the make command

Usage:
To use this program input the name of a C++ file the you want converted into C. In order to do that after compiling 
the progran write ./a1 <name of the c++ program.cc>. The C++ file that you want to convert into C has 
to be in the main directory where Makefile file is located. After the program runs it will produce a file called the same name 
but ending with a .c insted of .cc. That file will also be located in programs main directory

Known limitations:
You can't input any file names of files that dont exist
You can't leave the sapace for the name of the program blank. You have to give it a name of a file
